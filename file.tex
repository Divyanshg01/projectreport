\section{Fault Classification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item{There are primarily open and short circuit faults}
    \item{Faults can be located using terminal fault location methods or cable screening methods}

    \item{Open Circuit fault occurs in the series of transmission line - Open Conductor Fault , 2 open conductor fault , 3 open conductor fault which causes excessive current to flow into the system}
    \item{They can be tolerated but if higher power then insulation breaks down and short circuit fault occurs}
    \item{Short Circuit Fault occurs due to insulation failure between a phase conductors and ground}
    \item{These includes}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item{Symmetrical Faults}
            \item{Unsymmetrical Faults}
        \end{enumerate}
        \vspace{40pt}
    \subsection{Symmetrical Faults}
    \item{Arcing due to faults can lead to fire}
    \item{Voltage can fall below permissible value}

            \end{center}    
        \item{Symmetrical Faults involves all three phases like}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item{L-L-L}
            \item{L-L-L-G}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item{Majority of symmetrical faults occur at generator terminals , system stays balance but electrical equipments can get severly damaged}
    \item{They are the most severe type of fault with highest fault current but they happens rarely}
        \subsection{Unsymmetrical Faults}
    
    \item{These fault causes unsymmetrical current , meaning variation in phase and magnitude throughout all three phases }

    \item{These faults are more frequent faults }
    \item{They involves}
        \begin{enumerate}
            
            \item{L-G} 
            \item{L-L} 
            \item{L-L-G} 
            
        \end{enumerate}

            \end{center}    
    \item{In these faults conductors make contact with other conductor or with the ground or both}
    \item{L-L faults occurs mainly due to 2 lines swinging because of high speed winds}
    \item{Here the system is unbalanced because impedance level in each phase differs , causing unbalanced current to flow between the phases}
        
\end{itemize}

\section{ Research Papers }

\subsection{Integrating discrete wavelet transform with neural networks and machine
learning for fault detection in microgrids}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Additional difficulties in microgrid fault detection due to distributed generation specifically the bidirectional flow of energy} 
    \item{conventional systems are ineffective due to low value of fault current in MG}
    \item{Techniques of protection differs on whether the MG is connects to main grid or is working in isolation mode}
    \item{It involves generator of different capacities and types of fault current producd at various levels}
    \item{DWT extracts wavelet coefficients}
